# Learning and Sustaining Shared Normative Systems via Bayesian Rule Induction in Markov Games

This is the code for our project on Learning and Sustaining Shared Normative Systems via Bayesian Rule Induction in Markov Games. Herein, we formalize the problem of constrained norm learning from observing other agents' actions in the context of Markov games in a multi-agent environment via approximately Bayesian rule induction of obligative and prohibitive norms. The environment is based on the [Melting Pot](https://github.com/deepmind/meltingpot) project by DeepMind taking together the different games [Commons Harvest](), [Clean Up](), and [Territory]() to allow agents to learn and sustain a range of norms to handle various dilemmas such as a tragedy of the commons, social-role conditioned labor, and territorial norms.
